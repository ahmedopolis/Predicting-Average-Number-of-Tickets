# Linear regression analysis of the number of average tickets datasets

A company wants to predict the number of tickets its helpdesk support team will receive when a new client is added to its account. To solve this problem, a dataset has been provided containing data concerning the current clients. For each client, it has a number key, its number of employees, number of contracts, and its respective industry. The data is saved in a .xlsx file where the data has already been prepared for data analysis. Using Alteryx, a linear regression was conducted, and the resulting empirical equations were used to predict the number of new staff needed for a hypothetical client.
